  ### About me
<p>
I am a PhD Candidate in Human Geography in the University of Toronto's <a href="https://www.geography.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/liam-fox">Department of Geography & Planning</a>. I am trained as a political economic geographer, with an MA from Simon Fraser University and a BA in Canadian Studies, also from U of T.

My dissertation research examines the rise of extractive populism in the Canadian Prairies. I follow its making into previous moments of crisis within the colonial state of Canada, exploring themes of race and gender in the political cultures of extractive workers. I have also studied and written about the politics of the Canadian environmental assessment regime for oil and gas pipelines. Generally, in my research, I try to understand the many material cultures of extractivism using political economic/ecological approaches.
